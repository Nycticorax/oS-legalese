< NEW >
=== Duty of restraint ===
1. Restraint is expected from current and former Board members during elections. Attacking a candidate's ideas is fine, attacking a candidate is not. This means that when talking publicly about candidates in their capacity of member or former member, they should seek to prioritize channels and platforms that:
- allow candidates to reply
- allow the community to follow and discuss claims and replies from both sides
- provide reliable records of all exchanges, preserving the sequence of the discourse and the context
- actionable escalation paths for both the speaker and the candidates in view of minimizing the risk of harming the candidates' and the community's reputation by spreading fake claims, unverifiable claims or claims aimed at harming a candidate's reputation.
2. Generally speaking official platforms and channels acknowledged by the community should be preferred over alternatives, unless those platforms and channels cannot uphold the above.
3. When in doubt, the Election Committee can be solicited to help determine if a certain
platform or channel is appropriate in view of the above.

== Election Committee ==

=== Role ===
The EC's role is to:
1. organize, monitor and run the Board elections
